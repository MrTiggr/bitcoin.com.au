<div class="leftbar">
    @{Html.RenderAction("Menu", "Nav");}
    <aside>
        <p>
            The above links demonstrate a basic navigational structure using an unordered list
            styled with CSS. Use this as a starting point and modify the properties to produce
            your own unique look. If you require flyout menus, create your own using a Spry
            menu, a menu widget from Adobe's Exchange or a variety of other javascript or CSS
            solutions.</p>
        <p>
            If you would like the navigation along the top, simply move the ul to the top of
            the page and recreate the styling.</p>
    </aside>
    <!-- end .leftbar -->
