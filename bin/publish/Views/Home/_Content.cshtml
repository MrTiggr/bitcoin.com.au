            What is Bitcoin</h2>
        <p>
            Bitcoin is a way to transfer value between people on the internet
            <br />
            Unlike many other payment options on the internet, bitcoin isn't owned by any one
            group or organisation; instead it is collectively supported by the community that
            uses it.

            How to Get these 'Bitcoins'</h2>
        <p>
            Everyone (other than the notable exception of <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto">
                Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, who made the first group of bitcoins) has two options in
            getting bitcoins. The recommended way is to trade something for them from somebody
            who owns these coins already. (such as goods, services, or cash). There are many
            places that accept bitcoin listed here: <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade">Bitcoin

        <h2>
            Now what?</h2>
        <p>
            Now that you know what bitcoin is, why don't you make your first bitcoin wallet,
            and start trading (or generating) them yourself. Set-up a 'e-wallet here: <a href="https://www.mybitcoin.com/">
                https://www.mybitcoin.com - Make sure you use a long and secure password!</a>
            or (instant, potentially less secure, no passwords) <a href="https://www.instawallet.org/">
                https://www.instawallet.org/</a>
            <br />
            You also have the option of using the bitcoin software on your computer and hold
            your own wallet; however it is extremely important that you both have a secure computer
            (both <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_your_wallet">software</a>, and
            <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Securing_Your_Computer">physicaly</a>).
